Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:
why do we need data structure?
Answer: Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing
information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and
used most productively.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Answer: Traversing , Searching ,Inserting ,Deleting
Sorting ,Merging
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Answer:Compiler system, operating system,database management system, numeric analysis
what is an Array?
Answer: A is a variable where we can declare seris of number.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Answer: Array is fixed, ArrayLink is dynamic.
what is LinkedList?
Answer: linked list is one of the fundamental data structures used in computer
programming. It consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data
fields and one or two references  pointing to the next or previous nodes
How is an Array different from Linked List?
Answer: An array is the data
structure contains a collection of similar type data elements whereas the
Linked list is considered as non-primitive data structure
contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.
what is queue?
Anwer:queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the
entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal operations
 on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position,
 known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known
  as dequeue
what is stack?
Answer: stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements
, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and
pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The
order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO
for last in, first out.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer:FIFO and LIFO are cost layering methods used to value the cost of goods
sold and ending inventory. FIFO is a contraction of the term "first in, first
out," and means that the goods first added to inventory are assumed to be the first goods
removed from inventory for sale.
what is the order of complexity?
Answer: If that's the number of memory allocations, and memory
allocations in general are O(a), then the total complexity attributed just
to memory management in the loop is O(n log(n)). Since the appending
work is O(n) and less than the complexity of the memory management,
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Anser:  comparison
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: duplication
what is tree in data structure?
Answer:A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the
hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a tree
 structure because the classic representation resembles a tree.
what is graph in data structure?
Answer: Graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected
graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics.A graph data structure consists
of a finite  set of vertices or nodes or points, together
with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a
set of ordered pairs for a directed graph
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Answer:ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  Constructs a
new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException class  with an argument indicating the illegal index.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: There are many way we cna copy array into another way  Manually
 ,Arrays.copyOf() , System.arraycopy() , Object.clone()
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Answer:Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index. On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node consists
of the data and the references to the previous and next element.
What is DFS and BFS?
Answer:BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree
 or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root  and explores
the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors
What is Recursion?
Answer:Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method
calls itself to solve some problem. A method that uses this technique is recursive.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Answer:A linear data structure traverses the data elements
sequentially, in which only one data element can directly be reached. Ex: Arrays,
Linked Lists. Non-Linear data structure: Every data item is attached to several
 other data items in a way that is specific for reflecting relationships.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Answer:Big-(O)- notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or
complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario,
and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used
by an algorithm
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
